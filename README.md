# statistical-quality

This research project is part of a PhD by Lee Jones and will examine statistical quality in health and biomedical research by focusing on linear regression models. The goal of this study is to explore current statistical practice and identify common statistical misconceptions and errors made by researchers. We expect our results will highlight the most common issues for regression analyses and demonstrate where training and reporting guidelines need to be strengthened. 

This repository provides the study materials used to recruit 40 statisticians, including the study protocol, consent form, participant information sheet, recruitment email and the formatted questions used to review papers for assessing reporting of linear regression.

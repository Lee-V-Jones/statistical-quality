# statistical-quality

This research project is part of a PhD by Lee Jones and will examine statistical quality in health and biomedical research by focusing on linear regression models. The goal of this study is to explore current statistical practice and identify common statistical misconceptions and errors made by researchers. We expect our results will highlight the most common issues for regression analyses and demonstrate where training and reporting guidelines need to be strengthened. 

We are hoping to recruit 40 statisticians, who will be asked to review five published articles via a short survey, which should take approximately 30 minutes per paper to complete. Eligibility for this study is employment (current or past) in a statistical role (e.g. statistician, data scientist). To enrol in this study, please email the completed consent form.
